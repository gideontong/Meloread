# MoodTextPlayer

## About

A Chrome extension that plays a song based on the mood of the currently browsed webpage. It scrapes the currently browsed webpage for the text of the article and/or document (ex. Google Docs) and parses it, transmitting it to IBM Watson Tone Analysis in order to determine the tone/mood of the current reading. It then offers the user an option to play ambient music that is related to the mood of the song.

Created by Gideon Tong and Jane Zhang at Hackathon by the Sea from December 1st, 2017 to December 2nd, 2017 in a 19-hour time period.
