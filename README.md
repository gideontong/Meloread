# Meloread

Meloread helps you pay attention to what you are reading by playing music based on the mood of the webpage you are currently browsing on. The user can choose between different options of ambient music.

It scrapes the currently browsed webpage for the text of the article and/or document (ex. Google Docs) and parses it, transmitting it to IBM Watson Tone Analysis in order to determine the tone/mood of the current reading. It then offers the user an option to play ambient music that is related to the mood of the song.
